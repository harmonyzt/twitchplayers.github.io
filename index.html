                <h2><span>MORE</span> THAN JUST A <span>SAIN PRESET</span></h2>
                <p>Twitch Players is more than just a mod â€” it's a new way to experience SPT, making it as close as possible to Live EFT. Not only does it allow you to customize bot personalities and names, but it also adds Twitch streamers into the game, making every raid unique and unpredictable. On top of that, the mod comes with a SAIN Preset featuring progressive difficulty scaling: as your PMC levels up, the enemies become smarter and more challenging. This ensures the game stays exciting and demanding, even as you grow into a seasoned player. Get ready for every raid to test your skills to the limit!</p>
