                <h2><span>MORE</span> THAN JUST A <span>SAIN PRESET</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch Players is more than just a mod — it's a new way to experience SPT, making your exeprience with fights as close as possible to Live Escape From Tarkov.
                    Not only does it allow you to customize bot personalities in its own way aside from SAIN but it also adds Twitch Streamers into the game, making every raid even more unique and unpredictable.
                    On top of that, it comes with a SAIN Preset featuring Progressive Difficulty Scaling: as your PMC levels up, AI enemies become more challenging and more accurate. This ensures the game stays exciting and demanding, even as you grow into a seasoned player.
